                                will take place in Montreal, Canada, from July 7-11, 2025 at the Université de Montréal, with a precursor 2-day summer school for early-career researchers on July 3-4, 2025. Over the course of the week, 
                                we will host a range of Keynote Reviews, Review talks, Evening discussion topics, and contributed talks, as well as poster presentation sessions. The conference covers a wide range of topics across climate studies, 
                                and we anticipate a diverse audience from PhD students through to senior faculty from astronomy and planetary sciences. In true Exoclimes fashion this is interspersed with long excursion breaks/free time/discussion time. 
                                In keeping with the spirit of past Exoclimes meetings, the conference will host around 200 delegates attending in person to encourage close interactions among participants where all participants are hosted at the 
                                Université de Montréal for accommodation, meals, and the conference itself.</p>

                    <p>JWST has provided a new wealth of information on exoplanet atmospheres, including one of the most critical components, that being the composition of cloud particles and their 3D global distribution.
                    <p>In this review talk, I will first outline the basic theories and multiple approaches applied cloud formation in exosolar atmospheres, as well as their general effects on the observed properties of exoplanet atmospheres. Moving through the historical context in brown dwarf atmosphere science to contemporary modelling efforts will serve to provide the audience with a broad literature review and context to the field. A simple interactive python based demonstration will be included to aid understanding of the basic methodology.</p>
                    <p>Moving into 3D, I will discuss how the field approaches this tricky topic using general circulation models (GCMs) coupled to various flavours of cloud models, from simple diagnostic efforts to complex microphysical models. I will showcase recent progress in the field using these techniques and how they have been used to uncover the complex interactions and feedbacks that clouds can induce in these atmospheres. Another interactive session will elucidate the time-dependent nature of cloud formation in 3D and the modelling of microphysics.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I will suggest what types of observational data and programs would best constrain the 3D properties of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres, as well as discuss gaps in theory and data that can be can tackled in future endeavours in the field.</p>

                    <p>The great distance to exoplanets makes it impossible to resolve their disk with current or near-term technology. It is still possible, however, to deduce spatial inhomogeneities in exoplanets provided that different regions are visible at different times—this can be due to rotation, orbital motion, or occultations by a star, planet, or moon. We can also monitor atmospheric time-variability due to seasons and weather.  Finally, winds can be directly probed via Doppler-shifted atmospheric lines. I will review techniques for mapping the atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets at low and high spectral resolution for synchronously rotating planets, eccentric planets, those on long-period orbits, and free-floating planets.  I will outline how we constrain the wind direction, wind speed, vertical mixing, atmospheric variability, cloud and chemical inhomogeneities. </p>

                    <p>The discovery of more than 6,000 exoplanets imposes outstanding questions related to our origins: How do planets evolve? Is our Solar System common? How and where can life emerge? To answer these fundamental questions, we need to understand the physical processes underlying the formation and evolution of planets, principal among them atmospheric escape. Since 2003, we have used space- and ground-based observatories to detect evaporating exoplanets in transit spectroscopy, as well as the end-products of photoevaporation (i.e., bare-rock planets orbiting M dwarfs), but it seems that the more we observe, the more mysteries emerge. Great sophistication is now required of physical models to help us understand some of these mysteries, and we cannot ignore anymore complications such as three-dimensionality, stellar activity, magnetic field interactions, and the impact of metallicity. In this talk, I will discuss some of the major discoveries in this research area, as well as avenues for further advancing our understanding of atmospheric evolution beyond the Solar System.</p>

                    <p>In the past three years, JWST has brought the atmospheres of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes into view, raising new questions about their interior compositions and origins. However, the atmospheric compositions we measure are not necessarily representative of the bulk planet. Interpreting JWST measurements in the context of planetary interiors and formation therefore requires consideration of the atmosphere-interior connection. Different temperature regimes can provide complementary information, from the evaporating surfaces of lava worlds to the larger atmospheric scale heights of mini-Neptunes. In this talk, I will discuss recent JWST observations, and some of the key atmosphere-interior interactions needed to connect them to the planetary interior.</p>

                    <p>The atmospheric dynamics of the Solar System's gas giants-Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune-serve as a natural laboratory for understanding rapidly rotating giant atmospheres. Despite their diverse characteristics, they exhibit intriguing similarities such as large-scale alternating zonal jet streams, prominent vortices, and wave activity, suggesting potential common dynamical mechanisms driven by rotation, convection, and differential heating. Leveraging advanced observational data and state-of-the-art numerical modeling, we are increasingly able to disentangle these processes. One of the most interesting puzzles is the contrasting behavior of equatorial jets- prograde on gas giants versus retrograde on ice giants-which often leads to differentiated treatment between these planetary types. We will examine this and offer an alternative perspective. Understanding the atmospheric dynamics of these solar system giants provides an important context for interpreting the growing wealth of data from exoplanets with similar bulk properties, anticipated to expand with missions like PLATO and Ariel. This review synthesizes the principles governing these atmospheres, highlights open questions, and discusses their broader relevance for planetary science.</p>

                    <p>In recent years, high resolution spectroscopy (HRS; R ⪆ 20,000) from ground-based telescopes in the optical and near-infrared has proven to be a powerful probe of exoplanet atmospheres. Through transmission spectroscopic observations during transits, and phase-curve observations of both transiting and non-transiting exoplanets throughout their orbits, we have been able to investigate the chemical compositions, atmospheric dynamics, and temperature structures of a diverse range of exoplanetary systems.
                        In this review talk, I will first introduce the methods used to study exoplanet atmospheres via HRS, and provide an overview of the current suite of spectrographs and telescopes being employed for this work. I will demonstrate how HRS allows us to disentangle exoplanet signals from both stellar and telluric contamination, and show how these methods can be used to probe atmospheric chemistry through single-line detections as well as cross-correlation techniques that leverage hundreds to thousands of spectral lines simultaneously.
                        Following this, I will provide a broad overview of atmospheric species detected to date, and outline how these detections can be used to gain insights into exoplanet formation and evolution. I will then discuss recent advances in the field, such as synergies with lower-resolution, space-based observations, as well as work making use of time-resolved detections to shed light on the inherently 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres.
                        Finally, I will look ahead to open questions that may be answered by the next generation of high-resolution spectrographs, including those on extremely large telescopes. I will conclude by highlighting current work and ongoing surveys harnessing HRS to expand our understanding of atmospheric chemistry across a diverse range of exoplanets.</p>

                    <p>Photochemical hazes have been found to be almost ubiquitous in planetary atmospheres in the Solar System and in exoplanet atmospheres. Typically, the haze formation process is initiated by energetic processes acting on carbon-carrying gases such as methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO), producing simple organic precursors that can then further polymerize and coagulate into complex macromolecular organic particles. One of the most thoroughly studied hazy atmospheres beyond Earth is Saturn's moon Titan, thanks to the Cassini-Huygens mission, which provided detailed constraints on atmospheric composition, vertical haze structure, and surface deposition over 13 years of observations.<br>
                    Laboratory simulation experiments over the past four decades have sought to replicate the rich organic chemistry and haze formation observed on Titan, which has been challenging to replicate through theoretical models. While photochemical models can reproduce the formation of simple molecules up to C6 species (molecular weight < 100 amu), they are unable to simulate photochemical hazes, which are made of a complex mixture of organic molecules with molecular weights of several hundred to thousands of amu.<br>
                    These laboratory simulation experiments typically involve simulating Titan's atmospheric composition, primarily nitrogen (N2) and CH4, and using various energy sources such as UV irradiation or electrical discharge to trigger chemical reactions. The resulting solid products, commonly referred to as “tholins”, serve as analogs for Titan's aerosols. Numerous laboratories have independently produced tholins under varying experimental conditions, including different gas mixtures, pressures, temperatures, and energy sources, since the 1970s. However, the lack of standardized protocols has made it difficult to intercompare their physical and chemical properties or to incorporate them systematically into atmospheric models.<br>
                    To address this gap, we initiated a cross-laboratory comparative study of Titan haze analogs in 2020, and now the effort has produced over 50 haze analog samples using 6 active haze production laboratories. Our effort focuses on characterizing key physical properties that are relevant for Titan exploration, including production rates, particle size distribution, surface energy, mechanical properties, dielectric constants, and optical constants from the UV to the mid-IR (0.19-30 µm) for all haze samples produced from various laboratories. We develop a standardized protocol for sample collection, transport, and storage to ensure the sample remains pristine during characterization. We found that the variation in methane concentration (1-10% CH4 in N2) does not significantly change these properties of Titan tholins. The choice of energy source, however, strongly influences the aerosol properties. While laboratory-to-laboratory differences exist, encouragingly, some shared properties emerge that may enable us to define common aerosol behavior for modeling purposes.<br>
                    In this talk, I will review recent laboratory advances in aerosol characterization with a focus on Solar System hazes, particularly Titan. I will highlight how these results inform modeling efforts in radiative transfer, microphysics, and aerosol-surface interactions, and outline pathways for integrating laboratory constraints into exoplanet atmospheric models. I will also present ongoing efforts to expand our experimental framework to exoplanet-relevant gas mixtures, enabling a more robust interpretation of hazy atmospheres across a wide range of planetary environments.</p>

                    <p>The search for life beyond the solar system primarily takes place as an investigation of planetary atmospheres.  The composition, chemistry and climates of planetary atmospheres are affected by myriad processes.  However, in all cases the interaction of the atmosphere with the deeper portions of the planet, whether its rocky surface, water ocean, or deep thermalised envelope, is fundamental in setting its observable properties.  Life then exists as a perturbation on this background of abiotic processes that set atmospheric composition.  In this talk we will explore the physical-chemical processes that set atmospheric composition, and how understanding these processes is central in our search for biological processes operating on exoplanets.</p>
