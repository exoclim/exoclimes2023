                        <p>JWST has provided a new wealth of information on exoplanet atmospheres, including one of the most critical components, that being the composition of cloud particles and their 3D global distribution.</p>
                        <p>In this review talk, I will first outline the basic theories and multiple approaches applied cloud formation in exosolar atmospheres, as well as their general effects on the observed properties of exoplanet atmospheres. Moving through the historical context in brown dwarf atmosphere science to contemporary modelling efforts will serve to provide the audience with a broad literature review and context to the field. A simple interactive python based demonstration will be included to aid understanding of the basic methodology.</p>
                        <p>Moving into 3D, I will discuss how the field approaches this tricky topic using general circulation models (GCMs) coupled to various flavours of cloud models, from simple diagnostic efforts to complex microphysical models. I will showcase recent progress in the field using these techniques and how they have been used to uncover the complex interactions and feedbacks that clouds can induce in these atmospheres. Another interactive session will elucidate the time-dependent nature of cloud formation in 3D and the modelling of microphysics.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, I will suggest what types of observational data and programs would best constrain the 3D properties of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres, as well as discuss gaps in theory and data that can be can tackled in future endeavours in the field.</p>

                        <p>This study aims to characterize the internal structure of the atmospheres in the benchmark brown dwarfs binary system, WISE J104915.57--531906.1AB. This binary system is the closest and brightest to us and is composed of a primary L7.5 (WISE 1049A) and a secondary T0.5 (WISE 1049B). As both objects are in the L/T transition, we are interested in studying their variability because although both components vary significantly, B presents higher variability than A. We use data from 7h of time-resolved spectroscopy (~57100 spectra for each object) to study their variability, taken by NIRSpec/PRISM BOTS on board JWST (GO 2965).</p>
                        <p>We select 10 molecular bands in each object's spectrum and calculate their respective light curves. We find the best fit of a sum of sinusoidal functions at the light curves using statistical methods like the f-test. The best fit gives us information about the number of bands present in the atmosphere for that specific depth. Studying the residuals, we found regions of the light curves that could not be accounted for with our sum of sinusoidal functions. We interpret this behavior as spots in the object's atmosphere, which may repeat in the light curve with each successive rotation of the brown dwarf. </p>    
                        <p>From analyzing the contribution functions generated by radiative transfer models, we locate the molecular bands at different pressure depths to generate the first atmospheric map using the JWST data. Thanks to these data, we infer a preliminary vertical structure and have a 3D view of a brown dwarf for the first time.</p>

                        <p>Spectroscopic phase curves are treasure troves of information, enabling us to make 3D scans of planetary atmospheres and observe the longitudinally dependent distributions of chemical species. This is important, because the atmospheric composition of tidally locked gas giants is determined by locally varying parameters such as the temperature, the wind dynamics, and the incident radiation coming from the host star. As such, the planet shows distinct atmospheric signatures dependent on the phase during which it is observed. Now, with the unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope, we can finally gain insight in the physical and chemical processes that occur in a planetary atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>During this presentation, we will present a suite of one-, two-, and three-dimensional photochemical models, exploring in detail the chemistry of the hot Jupiter WASP-43 b. We will match our photochemical results to constraints offered by the mid-infrared phase curve that was obtained using the James Webb Space Telescope (Bell et al. 2024) and derive insights into the metallicity, vertical mixing rate, and wind dynamics of WASP-43 b. Intriguingly, we determine both dynamical and chemical mechanisms that cause a depletion of methane. This presentation will highlight the information content provided to us by phase curves and enable future studies of the chemical distributions of tidally locked exoplanets.</p>

                        <p>Clouds play a crucial role in shaping the atmospheres of exoplanets, influencing their albedo, heat distribution, and spectrum. While most past studies focused on hot and ultra-hot planets, JWST now allows an in-depth characterisation of warm objects, where the interactions between cloud, circulation, and radiative transfer are yet to be studied in detail.</p>
                        <p>In this study, we integrate physically motivated, radiatively active, tracer-based clouds in General Circulation Models (GCMs) to analyze the atmosphere of WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter orbiting an M-dwarf star. This planet, with an equilibrium temperature of ~800 K, is analogous to warm sub-Neptunes, making it a crucial target for understanding sub-Neptune atmospheres. We take advantage of the high-quality dataset from JWST obtained through the MANATEE GTO collaboration, allowing us to jointly interpret both high-quality panchromatic emission and absorption spectra ranging from 2.5 to 12 microns with the outputs from a GCM. We provide an in-depth characterisation of the planet's atmospheric dynamics and molecular distribution, including unique photochemical molecules. Realistic insights into the distribution of clouds composed of various species, such as silicates, sulfides, and chlorides, with varying particle sizes were obtained.</p>
                        <p>While both emission and transmission spectra are very well fitted by cloudless GCMs, the data also appears compatible with small KCl cloud particles, but Na2S condensates can be ruled out due to the strength of their radiative feedback. This showcases the unique insights that can be obtained from global modelling of exoplanet atmospheres.</p>
                        <p>Our results point towards a homogeneous atmosphere with minimal temperature contrast between the day and night sides, suggesting efficient heat redistribution. Additionally, the presence of photochemical products such as CS2 and the relatively low abundance of CH4 point to active atmospheric chemistry and the possibility of a high internal heat flux. This work not only provides a comprehensive framework for interpreting JWST observations but also enhances the capabilities of GCMs in characterizing the global atmospheres of exoplanets in the JWST era.</p>

                        <p>Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres are expected to possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas. Chemical interactions between the atmosphere and interior could potentially play a critical role in shaping the planet's atmospheric composition and interior structure. Early JWST observations have found a number of highly metal-enriched sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result either from accretion of heavy elements at formation or from magma-atmosphere interactions. Most previous work examining these interactions has been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere, which is probed by spectroscopic observations.</p>
                        <p>In this talk, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary as well as different core and mantle compositions impact the resulting upper atmospheric composition.</p>
                        <p>We compare our findings to recent JWST observations of sub-Neptune atmospheres. In particular, we find that the upper atmosphere of TOI-270 d as measured from its JWST transmission spectrum can be explained as the outcome of interactions between the atmosphere, core and mantle, assuming that the planet originally accreted a solar composition envelope. We discuss the implications of this finding, as well as the further modeling improvements that will be required to fully understand the impact of these processes on atmospheres of the broader sub-Neptune population.</p>

                        <p>Assessing the prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets around M-dwarf stars is a top priority of exoplanet science. High-energy activity from M-dwarfs can destroy the atmospheres of these planets, which could in turn explain the lack of atmospheric detections to date. Volcanic outgassing has been proposed as a mechanism to replenish the atmospheres of tidally heated rocky planets. Similarly, L98-59b, a sub-Earth transiting a nearby M dwarf, was recently identified as the most promising exoplanet to detect tidally driven volcanism. We present the transmission spectrum of L98-59b from four transits observed with JWST/NIRSpec. We find a 3.6<span class="math">\( \sigma \)</span> preference for an SO2 atmosphere over the no-atmosphere model based on the Bayesian evidence. The best-fit atmospheric model is in excellent agreement with literature predictions that modeled tidal dissipation on this planet. Such an atmosphere would likely be in a steady state where volcanism balances escape. If so, L98-59b must experience at least eight times as much volcanism and tidal heating per unit mass as Io. If volcanism is driven by runaway melting of the mantle, we predict the existence of a subsurface magma ocean in L98-59b extending up to 60-90% of the planet radius. An SO2-rich volcanic atmosphere on L98-59b would be indicative of an oxidized mantle with an oxygen fugacity of fO2>IW+2.7, and it would imply that L98-59b must have retained some of its volatile endowment despite its proximity to its star. Our findings suggest that volcanism may revive secondary atmospheres on tidally heated rocky planets around M-dwarfs.</p>

                        <p>One of the key questions in exoplanetary science is determining whether close-in rocky planets can retain atmospheres. A particularly exciting case is that of ultra-short-period, highly irradiated rocky planets, which are predicted to give rise to exotic atmospheres unlike those observed in our Solar System. These planets provide a unique opportunity to explore the predicted compositional diversity resulting from outgassing and surface evaporation. Exposed to intense irradiation that likely strips away their primordial atmospheres, these planets may host secondary atmospheres enriched with species such as Na, O, and SiO.</p>
                        <p>Here, we present the first near-infrared transmission and emission spectra of the lava world K2-141b, a 1.58 <span class="math">\( R_\oplus \)</span>, 2.31 <span class="math">\( M_\oplus \)</span>, T~2000K hot rocky exoplanet orbiting a K-dwarf star with an ultra-short orbital period of only 7 hours. These precise measurements, obtained using the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST (PID 2159; PI: Espinoza), allow us to place strong constraints on the atmospheric make-up of this lava world and provide an unprecedented view of these worlds between 3-5 µm. These findings contribute to understanding the evolutionary pathways of ultra-short-period rocky planets (P < 1 day, RP < 2 <span class="math">\( R_\oplus \)</span>), thought to be the stripped cores of mini-Neptunes, and offer valuable insights into planetary formation and survival in highly irradiated environments.  </p>

                        <p>The ice giants in our solar system (Uranus and Neptune) and their metal-rich atmospheres hold important clues about how our solar system formed and evolved. Exo-Neptunes likewise hold critical information about planet formation beyond our solar system, providing an important bridge between the Jupiter-sized and abundant sub-Neptune-sized exoplanet populations. Unlocking the hidden secrets of exo-Neptunes requires careful consideration of their complex carbon chemistry, which is shaped by both atmospheric metallicity and disequilibrium processes.</p>
                        <p>In this talk, I will present the transmission spectrum of the stand-out ~800K exo-Neptune HAT-P-11b as observed with JWST, with the aim of refining its unexpectedly sub-solar metallicity as observed by Hubble when compared to planets of similar mass, and reconciling its low IR transit depths as observed by Spitzer. We also highlight the necessary synergy between Hubble and JWST observations when interpreting the spectra of a planet orbiting an active host star. Our NIRSpec/G395H transmission unlocks a comprehensive view of the carbon inventory of the atmosphere for the first time, allowing us to test the validity of prior understanding, examining and perhaps disentangling the chemical and dynamical processes occurring within exoplanet atmospheres near the CO-CH4 transition.</p>

                        <p>Clouds have long been thought to shape the climates of exoplanets as much, if not more so, than clouds in the atmospheres of solar system objects. Clouds interact with atmospheric radiative transfer, chemistry, and dynamics such that they are both of first-order importance in understanding climate and can be used as tracers of fundamental planetary properties. With the advent of JWST, it is now apparent that non-gray clouds are required to interpret the atmospheres of nearly all planets, even those previously thought to be free of observable clouds (e.g., WASP-39b).</p>
                        <p>Despite a myriad of predictions that clouds are highly sensitive to atmospheric dynamics such that cloud-cover is likely to vary spatially, directly observing inhomogeneous aerosol coverage has been unfeasible for the vast majority of exoplanet phase-space until recently. With precise JWST data, it is now possible to separate limb-resolved transmission spectra that probe exoplanet atmospheres at spatially distinct locations for planets with diverse periods, temperatures, radii, and more.</p>
                        <p>Here, I present the theoretical underpinnings and initial results from the JWST Mornings & Evenings Program (PID 3969) which targets limb-asymmetry spectra of 6 hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures spanning 1000-2000 K. I will present the primary motivation for this program: new 2D models of microphysical clouds on hot Jupiters that predict distinct observable trends in inhomogeneous cloud coverage. I will discuss how the 2D interaction between cloud microphysics and dynamical transport substantially alters predictions about cloud-coverage and observed atmospheric properties from the 1D case and how these recent observations are able to place novel constraints on cloud formation and evolution processes. I will describe how the initial results from this population-level view of limb asymmetries on hot Jupiters both confirms and challenges state-of-the-art theoretical models — giving rise to new testable questions about the nature of these extreme worlds.</p>

                        <p>Observations and modeling of temperate exoplanets reveal potentially hazy atmospheres, coming as no surprise given the prevalence of photochemical hazes in our Solar System on bodies such as Titan. These hazes not only affect spectral features but also influence chemical and physical processes in both atmospheres and on planetary surfaces. Titan, the best-studied hazy world, forms haze through photolysis of its N2-CH4 atmosphere, producing complex organic aerosols that deposit on its the surface. These particles may interact with liquid surface water, made available through cryovolcanism or impacts on the water ice shell, leading to the formation of prebiotic molecules like amino acids and nucleotides. Laboratory studies suggest that a variety of exoplanet atmospheres could similarly produce organic haze. On water-rich planets, haze particles likely interact with liquid water after deposition, potentially driving prebiotic chemistry. Here, we perform a series of hydrolysis experiments on laboratory-simulated hazes representative of water-rich exoplanet and Titan-like atmospheres. Exoplanet haze analogs are formed through photolysis of gases at 1000x solar metallicity, while Titan haze analogs are formed through N2-CH4 photolysis. We determine the optical constants and chemical compositions of these hydrolyzed haze analogs, providing critical data for interpreting exoplanet observations and uncovering their potential biological relevance.</p>

                        <p>We present a population-level view of volatile evolution during the sub-Neptune to rocky planet transition, revealing in detail the dynamic nature of small planet atmospheric composition. We couple the atmospheric escape model IsoFATE with the magma ocean-atmosphere equilibrium chemistry model Atmodeller to simulate interior-atmosphere evolution over time for sub-Neptunes around G, K and M stars. Our simulations fully capture the transition from sub-Neptune to rocky composition atmospheres and reveal an oxidation gradient straddling the radius valley. We discover a key mechanism shaping the oxidation landscape is dissolution of water into the molten mantle, which shields oxygen from early escape, buffers the escape rate, and leads to highly oxidized secondary atmospheres following mantle outgassing. Our simulations robustly produce a prominent population of He-rich worlds along the upper edge of the radius valley as well as a broad population of O2-dominated atmospheres on close-in planets around low mass stars. These planets present a high-priority opportunity for the first-ever atmospheric O2 detection and have implications for biosignature definition. We motivate future atmospheric characterization surveys by providing a target list of planet candidates predicted to have O2-, He-, and deuterium-rich atmospheres. Finally, we present high-resolution transmission spectra that test our model predictions for a new class of planets: helium worlds.</p>

                        <p>We present the first results of the 50-hour JWST/NIRSpec phase-curve observation of the canonical ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b (data taken in January 2025). WASP-76b is one of the best-characterized exoplanets to date, having been observed with at least 10 different ground-based instruments. To date, 22 different atoms and molecules have been detected in its atmosphere, while 13 optical species (refractories and alkalis) have measured abundances. While such abundance measurements provide key insights into the formation/migration history of ultra-hot Jupiters, it is well-known that the extreme day-night contrasts of these planets can bias retrievals by orders of magnitude. This makes the interpretation of transmission and emission spectra a lot more challenging.</p>
                        <p>In this contribution we will present the white-light phase curve of WASP-76b, as well as initial reductions/analyses of the transmission and dayside emission spectra.</p>
                        <p>The aim of our JWST/NIRSpec program is to characterize the 3D thermochemical structure of WASP-76b in unprecedented detail and put constraints on atmospheric dynamics and heat redistribution. Additionally, we can use this 3D information to remove potential biases from retrievals based on previous ground-based observations. By combining these "updated" refractory measurements with constraints on the volatile budget from JWST, we can reliably trace back the formation/migration history of WASP-76b.</p>
                        <p>Another particularly elusive aspect of WASP-76b from previous ground-based observations is its asymmetric transmission signature, which seems to hint at stark thermochemical differences between the morning and evening terminator. Our phase-dependent transmission spectra from JWST will shed light on the physical mechanisms governing this asymmetry.</p>

                        <p>With JWST online, we are entering the era of cold substellar atmosphere characterization. The population of nearby isolated late T and Y dwarfs provide an invaluable resource to anchor cold atmospheric models ahead of the more difficult-to-observe true exoJupiters. Their high-SNR high-resolution JWST spectra encode exquisitely detailed information about atmospheric properties and processes. One such process is disequilibrium chemistry. As temperatures lower, atmospheric mixing can outpace chemical reactions and drive abundances away from thermochemical equilibrium. This phenomenon can reveal mixing strengths in radiative and convective structures below the visible photosphere, and plays an important role in interpreting observations. We conducted a comprehensive forward-model analysis, leveraging three state-of-the art model grids and JWST spectra from ~30 late T and Y type brown dwarfs in order to map atmospheric mixing strengths across the population. Observed nonequilibrium abundances support 1D-RCE models' prediction that objects cooler than 400-500 K have much shallower radiative-convective boundaries compared to 500-800 K objects. Results also imply that mixing in radiative layers is several orders of magnitude weaker than mixing in convective layers, and suggest that, even in convective layers, mixing is weaker than standard mixing length predictions. </p>
                        <p>To investigate this further, we have begun adapting the non-hydrostatic 3D modeling code CANOE to simulate the combined effects of convection, rotation, and condensation on such atmospheres, and determine whether the observed trends in disequilibrium chemistry can be replicated. 3D modeling will also enable predictions for viewing angle effects and help inform urgently needed updates to 1D-RCE models. Results of our analysis showed systematic discrepancies in the spectral residuals. The structure of data-model discrepancies hint that, at depths of 5-15 bars, either there is a missing cloud suppressing some NIR flux or temperature-pressure profiles deviate from a dry adiabat. Preliminary results from this non-hydrostatic 3D modeling will be available by July. </p>

In the coming decades, it will be used to characterize some of the first potentially Earth-like worlds, with the Extremely Large Telescope, in search of biosignature gases. Further into the future, the Habitable Worlds Observatory will use reflected light phase curves to hunt for exo-rainbows and ocean glint, telltale signs of liquid water--a key ingredient for life as we know it. To achieve these future science cases requires pioneering this technique with existing instrumentation. Here I demonstrate the use of reflected light at high spectral resolution to unravel the mysteries of unusual hot Neptune LTT-9779 b.</p>
                        <p>LTT-9779 b is a rare denizen of the Neptune desert and is one of only a handful of exoplanets known to be highly reflective. JWST observations revealed a relatively flat spectrum consistent with a variety of cloudy and cloud-free atmospheric scenarios. We aim to disentangle these using high-resolution spectra, in order to learn more about this enigmatic world and to illuminate its survival in the desert.</p>
                        <p>Obtaining a high-resolution spectrum of this world required combining the Very Large Telescope's four individual telescopes into the world's largest optical telescope using the ESPRESSO spectrograph's 4UT mode. Here, I will show this data and the constraints it places on the atmosphere of LTT-9779 b, which improves upon JWST observations by disfavoring a family of proposed models. I will discuss what this means for this planet's survival in the Neptune desert and the future of reflected light studies of exoplanets with current instrumentation and with upcoming observatories. </p>

This should help inform atmospheric escape models which have previously suggested an atmosphere on LHS-1140c is possible (Kite & Barnett 2020; Chatterjee & Pierrehumbert 2024). This has strong implications for the Cosmic shoreline model of atmospheric escape as both LHS-1140c and its less irradiated sibling LHS-1140b are some of the most favourable super-Earths to have retained atmospheres around an M-dwarf host, making this a potential benchmark system for atmospheric escape models.</p>
                        <p>We introduce a new technique to analyse these data by joint-fitting individual pixel light curves. Our method has the advantage of being able to weight away from particular pixels displaying increased systematics/correlated noise. This helped reveal a persistence effect from a cosmic ray which could be weighted away from using this technique. We also identified a pattern in the initial ~30-60 minutes of detector settling which appears strongly connected to the previous filter used by MIRI. This helps explain the significant differences in initial detector settling seen across datasets in the Hot Rocks Survey and is an important effect to understand given the 500 hour Rocky Worlds DDT survey extending this technique to more targets.</p>

                        <p>Atmospheric characterisation of temperate sub-Neptunes is the new frontier of exoplanetary science with recent JWST observations of K2-18 b. Accurate modelling of atmospheric processes is essential to interpreting high-precision spectroscopic data given the wide range of possible conditions in the sub-Neptune regime, including on potentially habitable planets. 3D General Circulation Models (GCMs) can provide the sophistication to model fully self-consistent atmospheres, but care needs to be taken with their modelling of complex physical effects. Notably, convection is an important process which can operate in several very different modes across sub-Neptune conditions. We develop a new mass-flux scheme which can capture these variations and simulate convection over a wide range of parameter space for use in 3D general circulation models (GCMs). We first perform an initial validation where we show that the convection model performs near-identically to Earth-tuned models in an Earth-like TRAPPIST-1 e convection case. We then perform simulations of a mini-Neptune atmosphere. Assuming the bulk properties of K2-18 b with a deep H2 - rich atmosphere, we demonstrate the capability of the scheme to reproduce non-condensing convection. We find convection occurring at pressures above 0.3 bar and the dynamical structure shows high-latitude prograde jets. We discuss the dynamical structure and the effect of convection on the wider climate state. Next, we assume that K2-18 b has a shallow H2-rich atmosphere with a liquid water ocean underneath. We discuss the general climate, dynamical climate and convective behaviour present for a range of albedos and surface pressures, and impose constraints on the possibility of a surface liquid water ocean.</p>

                        <p>Tracking the formation history of planets requires a holistic picture of their building blocks: ices, rocks, and gases. However, achieving this objective is challenging for many exoplanets, as well as for planets in our own solar system. This difficulty arises because, at typical exoplanet temperatures, most rock-forming species condense into deep interiors which makes them nearly impossible to detect.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, Ultrahot Jupiters offer a unique testbed for capturing information from both rock-forming "refractory" elements and ice-forming "volatile" elements. Their highly irradiated dayside hemispheres are in a temperature regime where both refectory species and volatile species are in gaseous form, and therefore can be sensed via emission spectroscopy. The ratio of volatile elements, for e.g., the standard C/O ratio, obtained via compositional assessment does not provide information on the solids accreted during planet formation. In contrast, refractory elements mostly remain as solids in protoplanetary disk and therefore a refractory-to-volatile ratio (tracer of rock-to-ice content) provides a complete picture on early stages of planet formation.</p>
                        <p>I will present a detailed overview of our campaign to uncover the rock-to-ice content of several benchmark ultrahot Jupiters - MASCARA-1b, WASP-121b, HAT-P-70b, and WASP-189b. Our IGRINS observations offer a unique combination of high-spectral resolution (R ~ 45000), wide wavelength coverage (1.45 - 2.45 microns), and large telescope diameter (8m). We detect a plethora of refractory (Fe, Mg, Ti, Si, Ca) and volatile (H2O, CO, OH) species using the high-resolution cross correlation spectroscopy technique, showcasing the compositional diversity in our targets. Beyond detections, I will also summarize our latest findings on the atmospheric dynamics, temperature structure, and elemental composition of the atmosphere of MASCARA-1 b. Our comprehensive analysis provides the first estimate of a super-solar refractory-to-volatile ratio of MASCARA-1 b, providing key insights into its formation and history.</p>

                        <p>Temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets could contain large inventories of water in various phases, such as water--worlds with water--rich atmospheres or even oceans. Both space-based and ground-based observations have shown that many exoplanets likely also contain photochemically-generated hazes. Haze particles are a key source of organic matter and may impact the evolution or origin of life, and their optical properties are imperative in aiding interpretations of observations using theoretical atmospheric modeling. Modelers have thus far had to assume haze optical constants which may not match sub-Neptune atmospheric compositions. Often orbiting close to M-dwarf stars, these planets receive large amounts of radiation, especially during flaring events, which may strip away their atmospheres and have the potential to accelerate atmospheric escape. Critically, it remains unknown how stellar flaring affects the formation, evolution, and optical properties of exoplanet hazes. In this work, we present laboratory investigations of stellar flare energies on laboratory-produced exoplanet hazes under conditions analogous to water-world atmospheres. We subjected two water-world haze samples to varying UV irradiation environments to assess how the hazes evolve over time. We measured the transmittance and reflectance spectra and calculated the optical properties of the hazes before and after UV irradiation across a broad wavelength range (from Far Ultraviolet to mid--IR, 0.2 - 9 μm), which overlaps with HST, JWST, and the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory instruments. We find that simulated flares alter the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the hazes, and also reveal that the haze optical properties change during irradiation, which may change our interpretations of exoplanet atmospheric characterization. Overall, these laboratory-made hazes show signs of degradation over the simulated flaring period. Our results provide insight into the effects that stellar flaring events have on potential exoplanet haze composition, optical properties, and the ability for water-world like exoplanets to retain their atmospheres. </p>

                        <p>As the field of exoplanet science transitions from detection to detailed characterization, instruments like JWST are revolutionizing our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres and interiors. However, compared to atmospheres, the interiors of exoplanets are poorly understood, despite their role in interpreting atmospheric data accurately. In this talk, I will show how recent advances, including atmospheric metallicity measurements and Love number determinations for hot Jupiters, open new pathways for exploring planetary interiors. We present a retrieval framework that uses both atmospheric properties and Love numbers to constrain the internal structures of exoplanets.  The Love number, which quantifies a planet's tidal deformation, provides direct insight into its internal mass distribution. While only a few Love number determinations currently exist, JWST is expected to improve the precision of the measurements and increase the sample size, thereby facilitating a better determination of interior structures. Our framework is applied using two different models: a simple two-layer model and a more complex dilute core model. We show the extent to which the Love number measurements improve our ability to infer interior properties for the two different models and identify the Love number precision required for reliable interior constraints. Finally, we apply our model to hot Jupiters with existing Love number measurements, providing new insights into their internal structure.</p>

                        <p>During the early stages of planetary formation, planets suffer severe changes in their physical and orbital properties due to internal and external forces, which also affect their primordial atmospheres composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. The study of planets at early stages and their comparison with the already mature planet population is crucial for a better comprehension of different processes, such as: planet formation, evaporation of primary atmospheres of rocky planets, gas accretion or inflation.</p>
                        <p>As part of a large project to study the evolution, outflow, and evaporation processes of exoplanet atmospheres across different planet types and host stars, we conducted high-resolution transmission spectroscopy of more than 30 exoplanets to explore their atmospheres through the two principal ground-accessible evaporation tracers: Halpha in the visible, and He triplet in the infrared. We focused on young planets, in particular the sub-Neptune and mini-Neptune population with well constrained ages of less than 1Gyr. We complemented our survey with (nearly) all the available literature results, building the largest dataset of evaporation observations. We compared the observational results between young and old planet populations, using a sample that covers a wide range of the Mass-Radius-Period parameter space. This broad range of studied planets allows us to obtain a general understanding of atmospheres across different ages, radii, and temperatures, while minimizing observational biases in the sample. In addition, this large sample helps to identify what the next steps should be to understand the processes and mechanisms of evaporation.</p>
                        <p>This talk is based on published and new results from the MOPYS (Measuring Outflows in Planets around Young Stars) survey, complemented by the observations from the large HET/HPF helium survey and preliminary results from helium observations with the new high-resolution spectrograph NIRPS.</p>

                        <p>Ultrahot Jupiters present extreme physics and dynamics not found in the solar system. Possible effects include magnetic drag disrupting the atmospheric circulation, clouds confined to the nightside, and many molecules dissociating on the dayside. Spectroscopic phase curves let us measure these spatially inhomogeneous features and comparison with 3D models help us interpret these measurements and understand the physical phenomena behind them. However, previous phase curves with Hubble were limited to looking at a narrow wavelength range, covering one water band, which limited our ability to break the degeneracy between possible physical interpretations of observed effects. JWST presents the ability to measure spectroscopic phase curves over a broad wavelength range, allowing us to observe a broader range of spectral features. We will present how phase curves of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-121b from JWST's NIRISS instrument compare to a range of cutting-edge 3D models from different groups. While no single model includes all of the possible physics at work, by comparing varying models we can interpret what physical assumptions and effects best reflect the observations. The models used vary in metallicity, radiative transfer schemes, and physical phenomena account for such as magnetic fields, active cloud formation, and hydrogen dissociation.  This work highlights the surprising ways in which the 3D models and the spectroscopic phase curves of WASP-121b match each other and it's implications. This analysis also serves as a guide for how complex atmospheric features will present in JWST spectroscopic phase curves. </p>

                        <p>Transmission spectroscopy studies benefit from both ground-based and space-based observations as the two offer complementary advantages to one another, and capitalising on this synergy is becoming increasingly important as the field of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation continues to mature. In this study, we build on results from previous space-based spectroscopic observations from HST and JWST and we observe two transits of the warm Neptune-like exoplanet WASP-107 b with ground-based VLT/CRIRES+. Our observations were taken at a resolution of R>120,000 in the K-band (2.0-2.5 um), which is a wavelength range at which this target has never been studied before. Using the cross-correlation technique, we are able to both confirm and expand upon previous detections of several molecular species in the atmosphere of our target, providing further indirect insight into possibly ongoing photochemistry. Considering the unusual parameters of WASP-107 b (whose orbit is eccentric, oblique, and polar), we demonstrate that common assumptions--like the use of cloud-free models as cross-correlation templates, and certain treatment of orbital parameters like eccentricity and argument of periastron--can severely impact the Kp-Vsys detection map. With the aid of simulations, we show that these factors can lead to notable artefacts that hinder the interpretation of planetary signals and may even lead to spurious/incorrect non-detections. This is a key finding as the field continues to move away from primarily studying hot Jupiters in order to also explore smaller and cooler exoplanets of relatively weak signals, and we provide strategic recommendations for future studies of similar targets for both space-based and ground-based observations. </p>

                        <p>Efforts to infer the atmospheric structure and composition of sub-Neptunes have often been hampered by the presence of feature-attenuating aerosols. Though the exact nature of these aerosols remains enigmatic, both condensate clouds and photochemical hazes have been proposed as possible culprits for the observed featureless transmission spectra of exoplanets like GJ 1214b. Although models that consider clouds or hazes in isolation have struggled to reproduce these spectra, cloud-haze interactions may play a pivotal role in resolving this issue.</p>
                        <p>During cloud formation via heterogeneous nucleation, cloud species condense on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) before growing further. On Earth, as on Titan, complex hydrocarbon aerosols significantly contribute to the global CCN budget and thus play a key role in setting the atmospheric albedo and cloud coverage. Analogously, photochemical hazes on sub-Neptunes may act as crucial CCN catalyzing cloud formation. Interactions between clouds and hazes are thus likely to control the overall abundance and distribution of aerosols, with direct implications for interpreting atmospheric observations. Thus, a detailed understanding of the impacts of cloud-haze interactions is of first-order importance in interpreting sub-Neptune atmospheric observations. </p>
                        <p>Motivated by this prospect, we have developed the first 2D bin-scheme microphysical model of cloud formation on sub-Neptunes that includes interactions between clouds and photochemical hazes. Adapted from the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), our model includes longitudinal and vertical cloud and gas transport. Using this first principles model, I will present trends in aerosol coverage and particle size distributions that emerge across fundamental planetary properties such as temperature, atmospheric composition, and mixing. Our results not only have important bearings on the interpretation of sub-Neptune atmospheric spectra but may also help inform the targets that are ideal for future in-depth characterization with JWST. </p>

                        <p>Lava planets are among the most peculiar exoplanets discovered to date. Their bulk density suggests an Earth-like structure. With orbital periods of approximately one day, lava planets may serve as better targets for studying rocky planets than other Earth analogs that orbit much farther from their star. Lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, causing their dayside to be hot enough to melt and vaporize silicate rocks.</p>
                        <p>Several studies have used melt-vapor equilibrium models to predict the composition and spectral characteristics of lava planet atmospheres. The composition of such an atmosphere is determined by that of the underlying magma ocean, which is intimately linked to the dynamics of the silicate interior. However, the internal dynamic of lava planets is poorly understood.</p>
                        <p>We conducted multiphase fluid dynamics simulations to investigate the compositional evolution of lava planet interiors. Our model incorporates recent advances in mineral physics, including high-pressure equations of state that control melts and solid densities, and phase diagrams that govern the melting behavior of silicates.</p>
                        <p>When the magma ocean is global and well-mixed, its composition reflects that of the bulk silicate mantle. However, as the mantle crystallizes, the composition of the magma ocean evolves, leaving a shallow dayside magma ocean enriched in FeO and other incompatible elements. Interestingly, this enriched layer becomes buried in the deep mantle as FeO-rich liquids are denser than silicate solids at high pressure. Our simulations indicate a correlation between the dayside atmospheric composition and the nightside surface temperature, which probes the internal temperature of the planet.</p> 
                        <p>While characterizing the atmospheric composition remains challenging with telescopes such as James Webb, measuring the nightside temperature is readily accessible and might offer invaluable constraints on the thermochemical evolution of these distant rocky worlds. </p>
